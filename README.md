An open work space to act as a coding playground to show off my software dev, GIS, and archaeological skills. Currently a work in progress of an interactive web map functioning as a CV/resume as well as a portfollio for GIS, 3D modeling, and archaeological work.


ROUGH DEV PLAN::

- Build a solid modular mapbox-gl base for customization and future projects. (Base Structure established 07/19/2020)
- Interactive front end displaying a updated CV/resume
- Integration of and image viewer for projects
- Integration of a series of high-res downloadable pdf maps
- Integration of 3DHop for 3D model integration

PLANNED FEATURES:

- Hover sensative features with click interaction (center on feature and load related text panel.
- Info tab and also be used to jump around the map (i.e. if you click on education zoom to whole education area (huge bbox of NKY and Lund, etc...)
- Integration of Turf.js for a casual GIS analysis playground
- Integration of 3DHop into Mapbox-gl, either will work in a popup or find a way to integrate directly into mapbox-gl.


POTENTIAL FEATURES:
-3D GIS integration?
